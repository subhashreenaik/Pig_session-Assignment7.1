Why Mapreduce program is needed in Pig Programming ?

  Though java is known to us but sql is easy for all of us.Like wise mapreduce programming in pig is easy to everyone.It takes 7 to 10 lines toexecute 
  code. Java requires libraries ,but pig doesnot require libraries.The Pig Latin script was is easier to read for someone without a Java background.
  Java is a great and powerful language, but it has a higher learning curve than something like Pig Latin. Therefore, using a higher-level language,
  like Pig Latin, enables many more developers/analysts to write MapReduce jobs.
  
What are advantages of pig over MapReduce?

   Pig is application that runs on top of MapReduce and abstracts Java MapReduce jobs away from developers.
   Pig Latin uses a lot fewer lines of code than the Java MapReduce script.
   The Pig Latin script was is easier to read for someone without a Java background.
   MapReduce jobs can written in Pig Latin.
   Java is a great and powerful language, but it has a higher learning curve than something like Pig Latin. Therefore,

What is pig engine and what is its importance?
   
   It acts as a interpeter between pig latin script and mapreduce job.It creates a environments to execute pig script into series of
   mapreduce job in parallel manner.
   
 What are the modes of Pig execution?
   
   localmode
   cluster mode
   
What is grunt shell in Pig?

   Grunt is Pigâ€™s interactive shell.
   It enables users to enter Pig Latin interactively and provides a shell for users to interact with HDFS.
   
 Is Pig latin commands case sensitive?
   
   Yes,pig latin commands are case sensitive
   
 What is a data flow language?
 
   To acess theexternal data,every language follow some rules and regulation.Data flow language an get a stream of data which passes from
   from one instruction to another instruction to be processed.Pig satisfy all condition.
